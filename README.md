<h1>THE ADVENTURE TICKET PROJECT <a href="http://www.theadventureticket.com">www.theadventureticket.com</a><h1>

<p>Open letter to the world adventure seakers:<p>

<p>This was a project I am developing because I want to learn more about web development and the technologies available.</p>

<p>Also I believe the idea is really cool and I would like to see it working even if it's just one time.</p>

<p>The only way this could possibly work is to have an interesting number of users. For that to happen I need the expertise of every programmer or maketeer or anyone that can contribute to the project.</p>

<p>This is an open source project where everyone is invited to learn and to teach their skills at the same time we build a tool that can promote random travel experiences to the world habitants for as long as there's internet. </p>

<p>We can discuss growth strategies and ideas of how we could make this a reality</p>

<p>I also intend to learn not only about technologies and programming but also the social side of how to find a niche of users, how to promote the idea, how to analyze the feedback, how to work on an online team, how to setup a collaborative working development and so on.<p>

<p> My friends, hold on tight to your seats because the rocket will be launched.....3 2 1 BUUUUUUUUUUUM <p>
