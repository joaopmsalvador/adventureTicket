<h1>THE ADVENTURE TICKET PROJECT <a href="http://www.theadventureticket.com">www.theadventureticket.com</a><h1>

<p>This was a project I am developing because I wanted to learn more about web development and the technologies available.</p>
<p>Also I believe the idea is quite cool and I would like to see it working even if it's just one time.</p>
<p>The only way this could possibly work is to have an interesting number of users. For that to happen I need the expertise of every programmer or maketeer or anyone that can contribute to the project. This is an open source project where everyone is invited to learn and to teach their skills at the same time we build a tool that can promote random travel experiences to the world habitants for as long as there's internet. </p>
