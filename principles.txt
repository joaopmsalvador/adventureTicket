#################### Code of ethics. ##########################

The mission of the Adventure Ticket is to connect persons with the same first name
and last name and to promote random travel opportunities or experiences to the World habitants for has long has possible.

Your email will only be used to contact you in case there is a travel opportunity or an unexpected
experience uploaded from someone with the same name as you.

Your email will not be used for commercial porpuses.

At any time you can unsubscribe your email from Adventure Ticket,
meaning that in the future you will loose an amazing opportunity, because maybe
in 10,20 years you broke up with someone you love and suddenly a
random person, with same name has you and because recently got a baby on
a wild nigth decided to take care of the baby meaning that will not use the around the world
ticket who had bougth 9 months before and that could had been for you if you hadn't unsubscribed.

Your email will be stored for has much as you want and I have resources to maitain this website online.



This is based on the idea that the first name and last name are the only identifiers
of the ticket. Some tickets have more information such has: date of birth, id/passport number, gender, country.
It depends on the company which fields can be edited or not after purchased. The assumption is if you have the same
first name and last name your chances of reusing someones ticket are very good.
You will never know if you never try. Some of the personal data can be edited before usage if you argue it was a typo mistake.

Adventure ticket is not responsible for anything that happens once users are matched and put into contact or any legal issues related with ticket usage.


#####################3 Users conduct ################3

You agree that you will be etticaly correct.

In case of a ticket match both persons will decided on the agreement. I present a few possibilities:
- The ticket is offered to the benifiting person.
- The ticket is sold to the benifiting person.



#################### INTRO ######################

The mission of the Adventure Ticket is to connect persons with the same first name
and last name and to promote random travel opportunities or experiences to the World habitants for has long has possible.

Most of the tickets are intransmisable, unless you find someone with the same first and last name as you. Check this story (LINK)

So I decided to build this project by myself in order to make make people slitely happier.

How it works?That's easy...

1 - People who will not use their fligth, train, cruise or any kind of instransmisable ticket can upload it on the website.

2 - Then, people subscribe to the adventure ticket.

3 - Then, once there is a match between the uploaded ticket and your first and last name the website will put both of you in contact.


####################### WHY ###########################3

Why should you upload your ticket?

- First, if you are uploading a ticket, it means something bad happened and you will miss your great travel adventure. I feel sorry for you, really!
- Second, if you are annoyed with some airline or whoever sold you the ticket and doesn't gives your money back, don't let them sell that ticket again and profit from your misery. For example airline companies have overbooking meaning that they sell some seats twice.
- Third, give just by the pleasure of giving "and spread love to the world" :) (what a shitty reason)
- Fourth - if there is a match with your ticket you will be connected by email to that person. It's up to you to decide if you give it or exchange it for money a beer or whatever is agreed in return.
- Fifth - If more people start uploading tickets they will not use, more changes everybody has of maybe in 1 or 5 or 10 or 40 years to receive a match email with a random trip like an interrail or a round the world ticket.
